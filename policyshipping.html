    <h1>Policy & Info</h1>
    <br>
    <p>We do NOT accept returns, exchanges, or cancellations. All sales are final once payment is received. You may transfer your payment to another nail set (of equal value) if your previous selected set has not been started.</p>
    <p>Due to the handmade nature of our product, we will not be held responsible if the wrong size is ordered. We have sizing sample kits available and a size guide to help you find the perfect fit. Please note that it is your responsibility as the client to provide your correct nail sizes.</p>
    <p>Sets are handmade so our average processing time is 7-14 business days (M-F). If there is a delay due to order volume, you will be notified.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Shipping</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Items ship within 3-7 business (working) days of purchase. Purchase date is determined by the day payment is received and processed. Any delays from PayPal or your payment provider will cause a delay in the fulfillment time of your order.</p>
    <p>Please be sure to verify your address is correct on your custom order form as this will be the address your order will be mailed to.</p>
    <p>Once a package has been mailed by USPS and a tracking number associated to the order has been updated, Press & Geaux Nails LLC hands over any and all accountability for shipping, transit, and deliver. Press & Geaux Nails LLC will not be held responsible for lost or missing packages and are not required to issue refunds or replacements on these orders. Per request, additional tracking information can be provided to include signature on delivery for an extra fee. Please send request through order form.</p>
